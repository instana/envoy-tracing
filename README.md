# Instana Envoy Tracing Demo

This repository demonstrates Instana's [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) tracing functionality
based on [OpenTracing](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-cpp).

## Supported Versions

Envoy Proxy versions 1.15 until 1.29 are supported by the distributed tracing based on OpenTracing.

With Envoy version 1.30 onwards, tracing is based on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/cpp/).
Visit the demonstration repository [envoy-otel-tracing](https://github.com/instana/envoy-otel-tracing)
for those.

## Prerequisites

A `docker-compose` installation running on your machine. This demo has been created and tested on Mac OS 
and RHEL with `docker-compose` and `docker-machine`.

## Configure

Create a `.env` file in the root of the checked-out version of this repository and enter the following content. 
The values need to be adjusted to your environment.

```text
agent_key=<agent secret key>
download_key=<download secret key (optional agent key with download privileges)>
agent_zone=<name of the zone for the agent; default: envoy-tracing-demo>
agent_endpoint=<local ip or remote host; e.g. ingress-red-saas.instana.io>
agent_endpoint_port=<443 already set as default; or 4443 for local>
```

In most scenarios only the field `agent_key` and `agent_endpoint` are required.  

A template [.env.template](.env.template) can be copied to `.env` for your convenience.

## Build & Launch

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

This will build and launch the following components:
- `client-app` service, a simple Spring Boot application that issues a request every second to the ...
- `envoy` service, which routes all incoming requests to the ...
- `server-app` service, a simple Spring Boot application that returns `200` to any HTTP request.

After the agent is bootstrapped and starts accepting spans from Envoy, the resulting traces in the Analyze view will 
look like this:

## Create an Application Perspective for the Demo

To view all calls in its own application, create a new *Application Perspective* from the *Application* menu
with a filter for the agent zone (`agent.zone`). The filter value must be the value of the `agent_zone` from
the `.env` file. If `agent_zone` is not set, it defaults to `envoy-tracing-demo`.

## Released Binaries

**Link**: https://artifact-public.instana.io/artifactory/shared/com/instana/libinstana_sensor/<br/>
**Credentials**: `_:${agent_key}`

Only `linux-amd64-libcxx-libinstana_sensor.so` is required.
